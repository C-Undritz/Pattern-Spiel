      Pattern Spiel (Pattern Play) is a quick and fun memory game where the player has to remember the display of colours on a grid and then recreate them.  
      There are set difficulty levels to try in which the time allowed to view the pattern, the number of colours and the grid size will change to ensure 
      that the player is challenged.  Not challenging enough? Then try setting up a custom game to really test your memory skills!  Each game is five rounds 
      and you will be presented with a score at the end to see if you have made the high score table.  Have fun!

      Instead of the set difficulties the player will be able to mix up the three parameters that make up the challenge of the game to practice or create an extra level of 
      challenge!  The three parameters are:
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Grid size: How many squares will be presented: in this game there are two grids – 3x3 and 4x4.</li>
      <li>Number of colours: The maximum amount of colours that will be used to make the pattern: in this game there three options: up to 4 colours, up to 5 colours and up 
      6 to colours.</li>
      <li>View timer: How long you will be able to view the computer generated pattern before having to recreate it from memory.  You can choose 5, 10 or 15 seconds.  Or; 
      no timer at all where you will be presented with a ‘Go’ button to click when you are ready.</li>

      Scoring.
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Players will be presented a round score for each of the five rounds and these will be summed to give a game score presented at the end of the game.
    </br>
      Scoring works as follows: for a pattern match the player will you awarded 60 points.  The player will then be given a point score for time taken which 
      is calculated as 60-time taken.  Therefore if player A took 5 seconds and player B took 7.5 seconds, player A would get 55 points for their time taken 
      (60-5), whereas player B would get 52.5 points (60-7.5).  This is then added to the match score of 60 to get a round score. In the example given player 
      A achieves 115 points and player B gets 112.5 points. For every whole minute that is taken, minus 30 is taken from the score. 
    </br>
      If no match is achieved the player scores no points for that round.

      High scores.

    <h2>
      The top three high scores for each difficulty are displayed in the ‘High scores’ section which can be accessed from the main menu.  If a player manages 
      to make it onto the high scores table then they will be made aware at the end of their game where a name (or alias) is required to be entered so that the 
      score can be saved.

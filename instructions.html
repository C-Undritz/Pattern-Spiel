    Pattern Spiel (Pattern Play) is a quick and fun memory game where the player has to remember the display of colours on a grid and then recreate them.  
    There are set difficulty levels to try in which the time allowed to view the pattern, the number of colours or the grid size will vary to ensure that 
    the player is challenged.   Not challenging enough? Then try setting up a custom game to really test your memory skills!  Each game is five rounds 
    and you will be presented with a score at the end to see if you have made the high score table.  Have fun!

      Instead of choosing one of the set difficulties you can also mix up the parameters that make up the game so as to practice or create an extra 
      level of challenge! The three parameters are:<br><br>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><h3><strong>Grid size:</strong> How many squares will be presented: in this game there are two grids – 3x3 and 4x4.</h3></li>
      <li><h3><strong>Number of colours:</strong> The maximum amount of colours that will be used to make the pattern: in this game there three options - up to 4 colours, up to 5 colours and up 
      6 to colours.</h3></li>
      <li><h3><strong>View timer:</strong> How long you will be able to view the computer generated pattern before having to recreate it from memory.  You can choose 5, 10 or 15 seconds.  Or; 
      no timer at all where you will be presented with a ‘Go’ button to click when you are ready.</h3></li>

      After five rounds, you will be presented with a final score for your game.  This is a result of how many matches were achieved and how quick the 
      patterns were recreated.  
    <br><br>
      Scoring works as follows: for a pattern match you will be awarded 60 points. You will then be given a point score for how quick you were, which is 
      calculated as 60 minus the time taken. Therefore if playerA took 5 seconds and playerB took 7.5 seconds, player A would get 55 points for their 
      time taken (60-5), whereas player B would get 52.5 points (60-7.5). This is then added to the match score of 60 to get a score for that round. In 
      the example given playerA achieves 115 points and playerB gets 112.5 points.  If a round takes over a minute; for every whole minute that is taken, 
      minus 30 is taken from the score.
    <br><br>
      If no match is achieved the player scores no points for that round.

      The top three high scores for each difficulty are displayed in the ‘High scores’ tables which can be accessed from the main menu.  If you manage 
      to make it onto a high scores table then you will be made aware at the end of your game where you will get the opportunity to enter your name 
      (or alias) so that the save button is enabled to save the high score.
